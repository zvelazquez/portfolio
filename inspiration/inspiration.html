           <p style="font-family: Jost;">This is one of my favorite bands (along with The Strokes). 
            They have an extensive catalog of music, which includes 3 studio albums. 
            While their style can be generally described as being along the lines 
            of alternative rock, they have also experimented with a variety of different
            sounds over the years, including shoegaze, grunge, acoustic, and folk. 
            Their music inspires me to expand my breadth of knowledge and experience 
            in order to adapt and develop my style, while also being open to experimentation
            and trying new things. (Also their music is great fuel for creativity and just really, really good)</p>

            <p style="font-family: Jost;">This artist's work features a lot of surreal imagery depicting quiet moments often
            reminiscent of childhood themes and dreams. It inspires me to expand my imagination 
            and look beyond initial perception and observation to think of the possibilities 
            that lay beyond the obvious.</p>

            <p style="font-family: Jost;">I recently discovered this designer about a year ago, 
            and was immediately impressed by his work. He has done a 
            variety of different personal pieces, as well as commissioned 
            work within the music industry. His work inspires me to experiment 
            and grow my skills as a designer by completing and working on not 
            only assigned projects, but personal projects as well, so I can develop
            my style according to my interests. We also have a similar taste in music,
            and so I love his posters and album cover designs.</p>

        <h1>My name is Zanett Velazquez</h1>
            <h3>My top 5 favorite musicians/artists/bands:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0epOFNiUfyON9EYx7Tpr6V">The Strokes</a></strong></li>
                    <img src="img/the strokes.png">
                    <br>
                    <p>I love this band because it is the type of sound I aspire to create sonically, and every single song by them is so good</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3btzEQD6sugImIHPMRgkwV">Wolf Alice</a></strong></li>
                    <img src="img/wolf alice.png">
                    <br>
                    <p>I love this band because I love the fluidity of their sound, and I think that the lead singer, Ellie Rowsell, has one of the most beautiful singing voices I have ever heard.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4nUBBtLtzqZGpdiynTJbYJ">The Voidz</a></strong></li>
                    <img src="img/the voidz.png">
                    <br>
                    <p>I discovered this band as a result of loving The Strokes, because this is the side band of Strokes singer Julian Casablancas. Their sound is much more experimental and grungy</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7Ln80lUS6He07XvHI8qqHH">Arctic Monkeys</a></strong></li>
                    <img src="img/arctic monkeys.png">
                    <br>
                    <p>I love how much this band's sound has changed and adapted over the years, and I think that Alex Turner has written some of the best lyrics ever.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT">Father John Misty</a></strong></li>
                    <img src="img/father john misty.png">
                    <br>
                    <p>FJM's music is a bit more different to what I listen to regularly, but his ability to blend genre's and appeal to different tastes while exploring lyrical meaning has made him one of my favorites.</p>
                <br>

            <h3 style="font-family: Gloock; color: #D94E4E;">My top 5 favorite musicians/artists/bands:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0epOFNiUfyON9EYx7Tpr6V" style="font-family: Jost; color: #4BA9D7; font-size: 20px;"">The Strokes</a></strong></li>
                <img src="img/the strokes.png">
                <br>
                <p style="font-family: Jost;">I love this band because it is the type of sound I aspire to create sonically, and every single song by them is so good</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3btzEQD6sugImIHPMRgkwV" style="font-family: Jost; color: #4BA9D7; font-size: 20px;"">Wolf Alice</a></strong></li>
                <img src="img/wolf alice.png">
                <br>
                <p style="font-family: Jost;">I love this band because I love the fluidity of their sound, and I think that the lead singer, Ellie Rowsell, has one of the most beautiful singing voices I have ever heard.</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4nUBBtLtzqZGpdiynTJbYJ" style="font-family: Jost; color: #4BA9D7; font-size: 20px;">The Voidz</a></strong></li>
                <img src="img/the voidz.png">
                <br>
                <p style="font-family: Jost;">I discovered this band as a result of loving The Strokes, because this is the side band of Strokes singer Julian Casablancas. Their sound is much more experimental and grungy</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7Ln80lUS6He07XvHI8qqHH" style="font-family: Jost; color: #4BA9D7; font-size: 20px;">Arctic Monkeys</a></strong></li>
                <img src="img/arctic monkeys.png">
                <br>
                <p style="font-family: Jost;">I love how much this band's sound has changed and adapted over the years, and I think that Alex Turner has written some of the best lyrics ever.</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2kGBy2WHvF0VdZyqiVCkDT" style="font-family: Jost; color: #4BA9D7; font-size: 20px;">Father John Misty</a></strong></li>
                <img src="img/father john misty.png">
                <br>
                <p style="font-family: Jost;">FJM's music is a bit more different to what I listen to regularly, but his ability to blend genre's and appeal to different tastes while exploring lyrical meaning has made him one of my favorites.</p>

            <p style="font-family: Jost; font-size: 14px;"><em>Most of my hobbies include engaging in artistic and creative activities, which I have always loved since I was little. I was in art camps and afterschool classes all throughout elementary and middle school, and have continued to practice and hone my skills over the years. Some of these hobbies I also have a deep connection with, particularly fiber arts, because it was my Nana who taught me.</em></p>
